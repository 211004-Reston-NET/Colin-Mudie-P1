            "Description": "Make Noise Maths is a Control Voltage Generator and Processor indebted to the classic designs of Don Buchla in his Model 257 and Model 281 function generators. \n   The design of Buchla's envelopes allowed them to easily switch between cycling and triggered envelopes, providing LFOs as well, and at high enough speeds, Oscillators. \n   This design was then appropriated for the Serge Dual Universal Slope Generator,\n   which is an apt name as it can basically create any kind of rising and falling voltage. \n   Maths continues in this great tradition of versatile and function-packed modules.",

            "Description": "Morphagene, from Make Noise, is not just an upgrade of their iconic Phonogene. It is a whole new way to deal with sampling and audio processing. \n   Recorded audio can be spliced and re-arranged, as well as directionally switched, playing forward and backward.\n   The audio can be Granularized and Layered for thick textures. \n   Sounds can be read off of an SD card or be fed in for live audio processing.\n   With voltage control over every parameter on the module, this is the ultimate sample mangler.",

            "Description": "Mimetic Digitalis is a powerful multi-channel CV sequencer from Noise Engineering that comes in compact 10 HP size.\n   The module features 4 CV outputs and a single trigger output. While trigger signals are output every time the sequencer advances a step,\n   the 3 CV outputs can be influenced and manipulated via the external voltage sources or simply dialed-in using the encoder.\n   Up to 16 CV patterns can be saved and stored in the sequencer’s memory. Zero and Shred buttons allow for fast zeroing and randomization of step values respectively.\n   Collectively, the set of features makes Mimetic Digitalis a great tool for the creation of both precise and chaotic CV sequences.",

The new module featured an updated OLED display,\n   hardware additions, and completely new internal software. Unlike its predecessor,\n   which is only capable of emitting clock and trigger signals, Pamela’s NEW Workout. can also output rhythmic waveforms.",
