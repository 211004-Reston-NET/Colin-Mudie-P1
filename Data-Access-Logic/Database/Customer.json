              "Description": "Mimetic Digitalis is a powerful multi-channel CV sequencer from Noise Engineering that comes in compact 10 HP size.\n   The module features 4 CV outputs and a single trigger output. While trigger signals are output every time the sequencer advances a step,\n   the 3 CV outputs can be influenced and manipulated via the external voltage sources or simply dialed-in using the encoder.\n   Up to 16 CV patterns can be saved and stored in the sequencer\u2019s memory. Zero and Shred buttons allow for fast zeroing and randomization of step values respectively.\n   Collectively, the set of features makes Mimetic Digitalis a great tool for the creation of both precise and chaotic CV sequences.",
